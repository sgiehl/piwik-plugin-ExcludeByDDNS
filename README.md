## FAQ

__Which update method should I use, _DDNS Update_ or _DDNS Hostname_?__

If available, ___DDNS Update___ is recommended. This method is a bit more complicated to set up, but it leads to immediately updated IP's, as the client will trigger the update whenever a new IP is assigned.
But it may not be viable for all users, eg. 
* Not all DDNS clients allow custom update-URL's.
* The client may be already serving another server and have no ability to talk to multiple servers at the same time.

So, the ___DDNS Hostname___ can be an alternative. Use a DDNS service that is compatible with your client and enter the hostname from there to have the plugin resolve your dynamic IP. The downside: Updating happens via a scheduled task every hour, so there might be small windows with the new IP still being tracked, but not the old one.

__What data do I need to set for DDNS Update__

You need to set a custom URL to be triggered for an update.
Your personal update-URL is shown in your Matomo installation (user-menu > Personal > DDNS Settings).

The URL has the following scheme:
```
http{s}://{matomo.url}/index.php?module=ExcludeByDDNS&action=update&token_auth={token_auth}
```

- {s} Use HTTPS if available.
- {matomo.url}: The URL to your Matomo installation.
- {token_auth}: A token auth (user-menu > Personal > Security).

There is no need to set user, password or domain name.
